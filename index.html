        My name is Sarah Saleh Mohammad EL Mustafah. <br>

I graduated from secondary school with a gpa of 94.7% in the science section.<br>

I graduate from Jordan University of Science andTechnology (JUST) in 2018 and I finished the bachelor degree in 
Network Engineering and Security with a very good GPA (3.3).<br>

Through my study years in Engineering, I used to be serious and responsible person.<br>
I'm always thinking for the next steps, very interested in the details, and this qualified me to rank in the 1st place out of 300 students in my 
university for 3 times.<br>

I have my own passion, I always work hard for self learning and 
self improvement. <br>
I'm a success hungry human and I will always keep going just to be a unique dentist and reach my goals.<br>

My hobbies are writing poems and short stories in Arabic and English and I shared in many poems competitions and I achieved the 1st place<br>
for 4 times in it and I wrote and published my own poems book when I was 16 years old.<br>

I enjoy learning new languages I can speak Arabic, English and Turkish,
hopefully to learn Russian too.<br>
